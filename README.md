# 2019-03-23
Got a message from github that the DNS was not set up correctly.
Namecheap DNS for thha.org had the following:
- A Record @ 92.30.252.153
- A Record @ 92.30.252.154
- CNAME Record www thhaorg.github.io

See https://help.github.com/en/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains#https-errors
Changed the A record to, and deleted the other one
- A Record @ 185.199.108.153

# 7/17
