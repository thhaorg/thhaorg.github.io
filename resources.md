## Architectural Guidelines and CCR's
[CCRs](THHACCRs90.pdf) The CCR's describe the covenants, codes and restrictions for Thompson Highlands.  All owners of homes in the Thompson Highlands area are obligated to abide by the rules set forth in the CCR's. These rules establish a standard for excellence and establish the association to provide a common benefit  for all owners.  The association maintains certain areas and green spaces such as the entry off Thompson Road, certain fences, the mail boxes, etc.

[Design Guidelines](ThompsonHighlandsDesignGuidelines.pdf) The design guidelines insure that modifications to landscape or structures in Thompson Highlands maintain the consistency of the neighborhood and are designed to improve the livability for all owners. 

The [Request For Approval](RequestForApproval001.pdf) must be submitted PRIOR to making improvements to your home or property.
Return the completed form to one of the Board Members or email to board@thha.org.
The board will review the form at the regularly scheduled board meeting, typically the first Monday of the month.
