Youve Got Talent Picnic  The theme was very popular and there was
good feedback that it was a fun event and should be repeated next year.
There were 12 children who entered the talent contest with all
receiving prizes for participating.<br>- $110 was spent on 3 cases of
wine. Only 1 case of wine was used, probably because it was a very hot
day, close to 100 degrees. Lori purchased the majority of the extra
wine and reimbursed the THHA for the cost. The rest will be saved for
other THHA functions/business through the year<br>-$58.97 was spent on beer  there was no beer left.<br>-The
Face Painter was paid $146.25 for 2 1/4 hours. There was some discussion
of whether this amount is high and we should pursue other entertainment
for next year. However, the children enjoy it and she did a good job.<br>.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Business:</span><br><br>- The decision of whether to return HOA dues to $125 for 2012 was tabled for a decision at the December meeting.<br>-
Pat will prepare the Winter Newsletter to be included in the dues
statements at the January meeting. Newsletter should include reminder
to trim trees; remove garbage cans from street on the day of the trash
pickup; pictures of the talent show are on the website  (Powell to
