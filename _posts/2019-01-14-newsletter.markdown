# UPDATE ON JUDGEMENT
A judgement against the Defendant who finally pled guilty to theft of mail and destruction of mailboxes on Hibbard Drive. I was asked to present a Victim’s Impact Statement (as a representative of Thompson Highlands HOA) at his sentencing for stealing mail from many mailboxes in the Greater Portland area, including those in Thompson Highlands and for the destruction of 2 mailboxes on HIbbard Drive. Since this was a Federal Crime, the sentencing was held at US District Court at the Federal Courthouse downtown.

- He’s a repeat offender and had already been sentenced to 24 months in state custody so he
was sentenced to serve the Federal charges concurrent with the State custody.
- Additional incarceration of six months
- Followed by Supervised Release of 3 years.
- Special Assessment of $100
- As a result of the Victim’s Impact Statement I read on behalf of Thompson Highlands HOA, he is also responsible for Restitution to Thompson Highlands HOA for the $500 deductible we had to pay per our insurance with State Farm as well as $6868 for the amount State Farm paid for replacement of the destroyed mailboxes and repair of the surrounding concrete areas.

# IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND ABOUT THE RESTITUTION TO THOMPSON HIGHLANDS HOA
The Defendant is a 42 year old man who has never held a job and has a long criminal history connected with drug abuse. The reality is that we will never see that money unless he’s able to turn his life around and get a job. At that time he will be required to pay $25/mo to Thompson Highlands HOA. Current Board members will probably have been replaced by new Board members and before this money is ever paid in full, checks may be coming and no one will know what it’s for. So, we’ll need to have younger neighbors with historical knowledge of this event to maintain contact with the Victims Notification System to update them with contact information. All the details will be on the website but people will have to know to look there to know who to notify of change in contacts or to check on status of repayment.

# NEW NEIGHBORS!!
You’ll notice the Roster mentions new neighbors with an asterisk *.  They’ve been welcomed by Heather Pool, our new HOA Welcome Representative. But it’d be nice if other neighbors also make a point of welcoming Priya Srikanth and Srikanth Srinivasan, 12570 NW HIbbard and Rosemary and Glenn Casamassa, 12512 NW Welsh.

# NEW BOARD MEMBER
 Our new neighbor, Rosemary Casamassa, has volunteered to be on the THHA Board of Directors. We’re excited to have her join us and she’s looking forward to meeting everyone in the neighborhood and serving our community.

# BRICK WALLS AT THE ENTRANCE AND BORDERING THE SIDEWALK ALONG THOMPSON RD.
In the Spring newsletter I mentioned our long-term concern with the condition of the brick Entrance and the brick walls along Thompson Rd. The contractor we hired removed and replaced damaged brick and reinforced existing bricks, as well as cleaned the street side and top cap of brick walls and removed moss. We’re pleased with the work he did and are happy that this has extended the life of the brick wall and entrance by many years — though there needs to be continuing maintenance for maximum life. 

# 2020 NEIGHBORHOOD PICNIC
We’ve enjoyed Ochoa’s Tacos truck at our last 2 years’ neighborhood picnics. But we probably should get creative and think of another option and theme for our 2020 picnic. All ideas welcomed!!! One suggestion I recommend is that we don’t repeat last year’s weather. In spite of the rain and the notification towards the end of the picnic of a tornado on the way, everyone pulled together to make it a fun event and all the extra canopies provided helped keep us mostly dry. THANKS for the great desserts and
side dishes!!!

# LIGHTS AT THOMPSON ROAD ENTRANCE
You may have noticed that there is currently only one light working at the entrance. The bulbs in these light fixtures burn out frequently and are also subject to vandalism. They’re very expensive to replace. We’re currently investigating better options for lighting at the entrance, including the options of LED or Solar lights. If anyone has expertise about these types of lighting, we’d welcome your thoughts.

# APPROVAL REQUESTS FOR HOME IMPROVEMENT
We appreciate your requests for home improvement approvals. I just want to update you that in the future all approvals will be conditioned upon your notifying immediate neighbors of your approved home improvement plans and the approximate timeframe for your home improvements. That way there can be no hard feelings about noise or potential debris left on your property. If there is any issue along those lines, just cordially inform your neighbor and they can discuss it with their contractor to correct the problem.

As always, we appreciate the positive attitude of our neighbors and all you do to maintain your homes so we have a beautiful neighborhood to be proud of.

Included with this newsletter is your 2020 Neighborhood Roster and 2020 HOA dues statement. Please return dues statement with dues and updated contact information if appropriate.
