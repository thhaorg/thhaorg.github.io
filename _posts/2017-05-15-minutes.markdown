# Old Business
Wally will start billing us $280/mo.as of June 1.
He said he'd been billing too little ($180/mo) for too long.
For the extra money he will plant seasonal  flowers and improve their landscaping maintenance.
We have 3 other bids from other recommended companies ranging from $250 to $380/mo.
