Their &#8220;tree guy&#8221;<br>will spray their trees to control infestation and the &#8220;tree guy&#8221; will also spray the HOA<br>trees at the entrance. This will be done in summer and in March until the infestation<br>problem is under control. The cost to the HOA will be about $180 each time.<br>-There was discussion about the possibility for the HOA to pay for a large trash/debris<br>bin to be placed in a central location by Washington County for a one-time opportunity to<br>dispose of large trash items. Lori Quiring will look into this.<br>-It was suggested that the next newsletter include a request that everyone asks their<br>landscapers not to blow debris into the street or onto their neighbors&#8217; yards.<br>-The Board used this meeting as an opportunity to organize the Winter Newsletter, HOA<br>Dues statements and Roster for mailing to all neighbors.<br>-There was also discussion of how to handle the issue with the neighborhood dog who<br>has been behaving in an aggressive and threatening manner to some neighbors.
