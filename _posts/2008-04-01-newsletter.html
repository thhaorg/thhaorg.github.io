<h1 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><u><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">Thompson Highlands Homeowners Association Spring 2008
Newsletter<o:p></o:p></span></u></h1>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It&#8217;s<span style="">&nbsp; </span>great to see
daffodils and tulips blooming in the neighborhood and everyone<span style="">&nbsp; </span>starting to work on their yards.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;ve never written a Spring newsletter but
there are several topics the THHA Board members want to present to homeowners
for opinions and discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please give
your opinion about the following topics so we can make decisions at our May
Board meeting.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You can respond to the
Board at <a href="mailto:board@thha.org">board@thha.org</a>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Neighborhood garage
sale &#8211; </b>there has been interest expressed in having a neighborhood garage
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us know if you would
participate; what dates would be preferable; if you would like to &#8220;piggy back&#8221;
onto the Bauer Creek neighborhood garage sale (we would have to ask them if
they would want to do that).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;ll take
into consideration what the majority want.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Annual THHA Picnic &#8211;</b>
this<span style="">&nbsp; </span>has been a very popular
neighborhood event for many years &#8211; usually held in early September.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We want to know if there is still interest in
having this picnic; do you have any suggestions for a theme in the future &#8211;
we&#8217;ve done the Oktoberfest theme and the Western theme. The cost for the picnic
in &#8217;07 was $2600. Your feedback<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is
welcomed because we want to meet the needs and interest of the neighborhood and
we want to spend the funds in the THHA account prudently.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Children at Play
Signs &#8211; </b>the Board has agreed to purchase portable<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Children at Play signs for use by any
household with children that would like one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Please notify us if you do want one. But<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>there is a very important responsibility that goes along with the use of
the signs: parents must still be responsible for supervising when their
children are playing outside;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>signs
shouldn&#8217;t block traffic but be placed merely as an alert to drivers that there
are children playing in the area; children should be instructed to be alert for
cars approaching and they should always get out of the street when a car is
approaching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The signs should not give
children or parents a false sense of security. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Parking<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Issues &#8211;</b> there has been a request to ask
everyone, particularly those in cul-de-sacs, to ask their guests to be
respectful<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when they park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should park along the curb and not out
in the middle of the street, blocking the driveways of neighbors or making it
difficult for someone to navigate through the street to get to their home.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Tree and bush
trimming &#8211; </b>thanks to everyone<b style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></b>for doing a great job of<b style=""> </b>trimming their trees and bushes as
requested in our last newsletter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please
continue to maintain them so that there is no overhanging onto sidewalks
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>about 7 feet clearance over the sidewalk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We&#8217;d really appreciate your feedback on the above topics or
any other suggestions you have for keeping this the great neighborhood it
already is. </p>
