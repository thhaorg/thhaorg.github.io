- We discussed the issue of a neighbor being required to trim trees that are blocking their neighbor's view.  Since there is nothing in the CC&Rs that require someone to trim their trees if they don't want to, nor is there any "right to a view" in Washington County or Oregon State regulations, we, as a Homeowners Association, don't have the authority to require someone to trim their trees to protect someone else's view.
